**`Digital Craftsman`**

Iâ€™m passionate about building software that solves real problems, with a strong interest in web development, game development, and software architecture. I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with different ideas, and constantly improving my coding skills.

Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from web applications to a 2D action platformer game. I also hold several certificates in software and web development, reflecting my dedication to continuous growth.

ðŸ’¡ My goals:

Gain hands-on experience in open-source projects

Strengthen my skills in full-stack development & software design

âš¡ Outside of coding, I enjoy challenging myself, learning new skills, and collaborating with others who share the same passion for technology.
